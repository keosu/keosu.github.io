<p>Hi! My name is Ali Bharwani and I’m a computer science student studying at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My threads (degree specializations) are in machine intelligence and info networks. In Summer 2018 I interned at Georgia Tech Research Institue’s CIPHER (Cyber Security, Information Protection, Hardware Evaluation Lab) working on cutting edge cyber security technologies. At Georgia Tech, I am  Communications Admin for GreyH@t, GT’s student led cyber security club. As a member of the executive board of GreyH@t, I help plan and participate in our CTF (Capture-The-Flag) events, host companies, and organize two weekly meetings where we review cyber security concepts.
In my (increasingly sparse) spare time I enjoy reading The Onion, messing around in photoshop, and eating pomegranate. I know that's oddly specific, but thats my passion. </p>
