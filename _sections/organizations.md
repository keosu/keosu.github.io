## GreyH@t
### Communications Admin

GreyH@t is Georgia Tech's student led cyber security club. As a part of the exec board, I help organize and participate in multiple Capture-The-Flag events such as the Raymond James CTF and CSAW 2018. Additionally, this year we are hosting HackGT's security track, which includes us creating a custom security problem for participants to solve as well as hosting a workshop on secutiy vulnerabilities. We also communicate with and host several companies throughout the year to give talks about important cyber security issues and hold recruitment events. GreyH@t itself also has two weekly meetings, a CTF meeting where we give hands-on examples on how to expose security vulnerabilities and a general body meeting where we review security topics.
